256ART Integration
The ultimate goal is to have Electric Metropolis fully hosted on-chain via 256ART, where each mint picks a random palette from the choices in the code at the time of mint, this choice will then reflect in the on-chain traits. I have gotten this project into the most cohesive 256 template, to where it will randomly select a palette based on weight and display that palette across all aspect ratios for the test mint but, I can not get the trait of the color palette to be shown for some reason and have struggled with it for weeks now.

If you’re also a 256ART creator, feel free to poke around the code and let me know if you spot any ways I could improve the integration.

# The Trait Issue (Where You Can Help)
I’m having trouble getting the on-chain trait to reflect any palette besides Warm Amber. Even though the color palettes do show up in the actual artwork, the metadata or trait reading always defaults to Warm Amber when it actually does render a trait

If you have any insight into how the 256ART trait system references code, or you spot something in my logic that’s off, I’d love your help!
I’m offering 15% of my sales from this piece to anyone who helps me finally solve this palette-on-chain issue. That’s how serious I am about nailing this!
